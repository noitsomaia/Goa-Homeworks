# Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, 
# and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

# Examples (input -> output)
# 6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"
# 5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

# It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

# Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

# For example:

# Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
# Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
# You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
