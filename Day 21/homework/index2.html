            <p align="center"> Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo) is a transcontinental country located in Eastern Europe and West Asia.<br> It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest,<br> Armenia to the south, and by Azerbaijan to the southeast. The country covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres,<br> and has a population of 3.7 million people. Tbilisi is its capital and largest city, home to roughly a third of the Georgian population.</p>

           <p align="center" class="blue">The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date from approximately 1.8 million years ago in the form of the Dmanisi<br>  hominins,a subspecies of Homo erectus representing the oldest-known fossils of hominins in Eurasia. Buffered by the Caucasus and<br> benefiting from the Black Sea ecosystem, the region seems to have served as a refugium throughout the Pleistocene, while the first<br> continuous primitive settlements date back to the Middle Paleolithic, close to 200,000 years ago. During the Upper Paleolithic,<br> settlements developed mostly in Western Georgia, in the valleys of the Rioni and Qvirila rivers. </p>

            <p align="center" class="culture">Georgian culture evolved over thousands of years from its foundations in the Iberian and Colchian civilizations. Georgian culture enjoyed<br> a renaissance and golden age of classical literature, arts, philosophy, architecture and science in the 11th century. Georgian culture was <br>influenced by Classical Greece, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the various Iranian empires (notably the Achaemenid, Parthian,<br> Sassanian, Safavid, and Qajar empires),and later, since the 19th century, by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union</p>

            <p align="center" class="sport"> The most popular sports in Georgia are football, basketball, rugby union, wrestling, judo, and weightlifting. Rugby is considered Georgia's<br> national sport. Historically, Georgia has been famous for its physical education; the Romans were fascinated with Georgians' physical <br>qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient Iberia. Wrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia,<br> and some historians think that the Greco-Roman style of wrestling incorporates many Georgian elements</p>
